# Fomotograph

Fomotograph is a practice tutorial to understand MVC design pattern in Ruby. [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) is the Ruby web framework used in this project. I followed a free course on Udacity to complete this project. Here's the [link](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud270) to the course on Udacity.
